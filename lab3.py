# task 1. Write a Python program that generates a list of squares of numbers from 1 to 10 using list comprehensions.ares)
squares = [i**2 for i in range(1,11)]

# task 2. Expand the previous program by defining a function that takes a range of numbers as input and returns a list of 
# squares for that range. e_squares(start,end))
